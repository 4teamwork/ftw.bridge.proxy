Introduction
============

``ftw.bridge.proxy`` is a small pyramid based web application for proxying
requests between multiple plone instances. It's purpose is to isolate the
plone instances by routing through this proxy. This allows to easily move
plone instances to other servers.


Maintenance mode
----------------

Each configured client (plone site) can be switched into maintenance mode on
the bridge. When maintenance mode is enabled, the bridge answers every
request to this client with a HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable).

The maintenance mode can be enabled in the manage view of the bridge
(``/manage``).


Installing the bridge
---------------------

Install ``ftw.bridge.proxy`` using buildout:

    [buildout]
    extends = https://raw.github.com/4teamwork/ftw.bridge.proxy/master/versions.cfg

    parts =
        pyramid
        serve

    [pyramid]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    dependent-scripts = true
    interprenter = py
    eggs =
        ftw.bridge.proxy
        Paste

    [serve]
    recipe = collective.recipe.scriptgen
    cmd = ${buildout:directory}/bin/pserve
    arguments = ${buildout:directory}/pyramid.ini

Replace the path to the pyramid.ini configuration file on the last line, if necessary.
Here is an example ``pyramid.ini`` configuration file for running the server with paster:

    [app:main]
    use = egg:ftw.bridge.proxy

    clients.intranet.aliases = dashboard
    clients.intranet.ip_addresses = 127.0.0.1
    clients.intranet.internal_url = http://127.0.0.1:8080/intranet/
    clients.intranet.public_url = http://intranet.com/

    clients.otherapp.ip_addresses = 192.168.1.10
    clients.otherapp.internal_url = http://192.168.1.10:8080/platform/
    clients.otherapp.public_url = http://otherapp.intranet.com/

    bridge.admin.username = admin
    bridge.admin.password = secret

    [server:main]
    use = egg:Paste#http
    host = 0.0.0.0
    port = 8000


Installing the plone addon
--------------------------

For interacting with the bridge there is a plone addon package named
`ftw.bridge.client`_, providing a PAS plugin for authenticating requests
from the bridge and providing tools for making requests. See the readme of
`ftw.bridge.client`_ for more details.
